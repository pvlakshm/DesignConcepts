## A Simple Solution

<pre>
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.

The intention is not to win any programming contest! All we need to do is build a simple six-sided die.

We characterize a die as follows:
- A die is something that a player can "Roll".
- The value (on the top face) of the die is a result of this "Roll" operation.

i.e., we characterize a die purely in terms of the operation that we can
perform on it ("Roll").

We implement the solution as in [App.java](src/main/java/App.java).
